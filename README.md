# **2dRNA: Deep Deconvolution of RNA-seq Data**

## **Overview**

**Bulk (RNA-seq)** measures gene expression for **entire tissues** but lacks cell-specific resolution, providing only an "average" signal across all cell types present (_unknown aggregation_). **Cellular deconvolution** aims to break down this bulk signal into **cell-type**-specific contributions (cell-type abundance fractions), offering deeper insight into the _composition_ of cell types within a sample.

We aim to bridge the gap between bulk (which is affordable but lacks cell-specific detail) and single-cell (which provides detailed cell-level information but is expensive and difficult to scale) data by learning a **non-linear** relationship between them using **paired samples** (from the same patients).

### Why Is This Important?

-   Many diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, involve **changes in the proportion of cell types** within tissues.
-   Understanding these changes can inform diagnosis, treatment, and mechanistic studies.
-   Bulk RNA-seq is affordable and widely available, making deconvolution a practical tool to use with existing datasets.

### Key Concepts for Non-Biologists

-   **Gene Expression** refers to the ability to use a gene's information to create functional molecules like proteins. **RNA-seq** (_a.k.a. GEP data_) quantifies the activity level (expression) of each gene in a sample or cell.
-   **Single-Cell RNA-seq**: Data that measures gene expression for _individual cells_, providing a high-resolution view of cellular composition but at a _high cost_.
-   **Bulk RNA-seq**: Aggregates the gene expression of _all cells_ in a sample, offering a _lower-cost_, lower-resolution view.
-   **Deconvolution**: A "reverse engineering" of bulk RNA-seq data into cell-type-specific components, estimating the abundance of different cell types.

## **Background**

### $S$: Single-Cell Matrix

-   **Dimensions:** $c$ cells $×$ $p$ genes ($c ≈ 5000$, $p ≈ 200$) for one patient.
    -   Multiple patients **stacked vertically**; real dimensions: \[$n$ patients × $c$ cells\] $×$ $p$ genes.
-   Each entry is a GEP for an **individual cell**.
-   **Expensive** to generate (requires cellular-level sampling).

### $B$: Bulk Matrix

-   **Dimensions:** $p$ genes $×$ $n$ patients.
-   Each entry is a GEP for an **entire** tissue (no cell-specific information).
-   Cheap to generate (high-level/abstract view).

### $R$: Reference Matrix (derived from **S** or simulated)

-   **Dimensions:** $p$ genes $×$ $k$ cell types ($k$ < 20).
-   **Aggregation** (average) of cell GEPs by cell-type from **$S$**.

### $C$: Cell-Type Abundance Matrix

-   **Dimensions:** $k$ cell types $×$ $n$ patients.
-   Each entry represents the **abundance** (fraction) of each cell-type for a given GEP vector or matrix.
-   $R × C = B'$ (**pseudo-bulk**; like **$B$** but derived from single-cell data instead of different bulk sequencing technology).

### Relationship: $B ≈ R × C$

-   Since **$B$** and **$S$** samples are derived using different technologies, $B = R × C$ does **not** hold ($B'=R × C$ _does_ hold).
-   **Goal:** Learn a non-linear relationship from **$B$** to **$C$**.
-   **Outcome:** Estimated **$C$** can be multiplied with any reference GEP matrix **$R$** to produce a single-cell-adjusted bulk vector that has more accurate GEPs than the input bulk.

## **Previous Approach: Scaden**

### Methodology

-   Generate **synthetic** bulk samples by **randomly sampling cells** from the S matrix and **summing** them to get a vector. Repeat $n$ times to generate the pseudo-bulk matrix $B'$ ($p$ genes $×$ $n$ patients) by stacking individual synthetic bulk vectors.

    -   Each synthetically generated bulk vector will also have a corresponding **cell-type abundance vector** which is generated by calculating the proportion (fraction) of each cell-type in the set of randomly selected cells.

-   Build a **non-linear deep learning (DL) model** that learns the relationship between the synthetic bulk vectors and cell-type abundance fractions.

    -   The result is a model that takes unseen bulk vectors $B_{new}$ as input and predicts cell-type fractions $C$ as output.

### Datasets

-   **PBMC ~10k cells**: [Filtered single-cell matrix (HDF5)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-granulocytes-removed-through-cell-sorting-10-k-1-standard-2-0-0)
-   **PBMC ~3k cells**: [Filtered single-cell matrix (HDF5)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-granulocytes-removed-through-cell-sorting-3-k-1-standard-2-0-0)
-   **ACT Annotations**: [Web Tool](http://xteam.xbio.top/ACT/index.jsp); demo option generates cell-type annotations for the PBMC 3k dataset.

## Novel Approach: Using Paired Data

-   Utilize **paired** bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data (from the same patients) to directly learn the relationship between bulk GEPs and cell-type abundance fractions.
-   Train a deep learning model on **real paired data** rather than synthetically generating pseudo-bulk samples. This ensures the model captures actual biological variability and patient-specific effects present in true data.
-   The model predicts cell-type fractions ($C$) for new bulk samples ($B_{new}$), leveraging the inherent paired structure during training to learn more accurate mappings.

### Benefits

-   Captures **realistic biological variation** across patients, improving generalizability.
-   Accounts for **technological difference** between bulk and single-cell sampling/sequencing.
-   Eliminates reliance on assumptions about random sampling during pseudo-bulk creation, resulting in a more **robust** model.
